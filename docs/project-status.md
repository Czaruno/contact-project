# Contact Project Status Tracker

## Last Updated: May 2, 2025

This document tracks the progress of the Contact Management System implementation and serves as a reference for continuing development across multiple chat sessions.

## Implementation Status

### Completed Files
- ‚úÖ `src/gmail-analyzer.js` - Analyzes Gmail communications for specific contacts
- ‚úÖ `src/utilities/knowledge_graph.js` - Knowledge graph implementation
- ‚úÖ `src/utilities/email_generator.js` - Generates personalized emails based on templates
- ‚úÖ `src/utilities/signature_encoder.js` - Implements stealth tracking with Unicode separators
- ‚úÖ `src/utilities/generate_top_contacts.js` - Identifies and ranks top contacts
- ‚úÖ `src/utilities/report_generator.js` - Generates various reports on the contact network
- ‚úÖ `src/utilities/outreach_tracker.js` - Tracks outreach responses
- ‚úÖ `src/utilities/importers/google_contacts_importer.js` - Imports contacts from Google Contacts

### In Progress
- üîÑ `src/integrator.js` - Partially implemented, needs completion

### Pending Implementation
- ‚ùå `src/contact-manager.js` - Main controller for the system (high priority)
- ‚ùå `src/batch-email-analyzer.js` - Processes multiple contacts in batches
- ‚ùå `src/calendar-analyzer.js` - Analyzes calendar data for meeting frequency

## Next Steps

Our immediate priorities are:

1. Create `src/contact-manager.js` - Main controller that provides a high-level interface for all operations
2. Complete `src/integrator.js` - Integration layer between the controller and individual components
3. Create `src/batch-email-analyzer.js` - For processing multiple contacts in batches
4. Implement `src/calendar-analyzer.js` - For analyzing calendar data

## Continuation Strategy

When starting a new chat session, use the following prompt structure:

```
I'm continuing work on my contact-project at https://github.com/Czaruno/contact-project.

In our last session, we [briefly describe what was accomplished].

According to the project-status.md file, we're working on [component being developed].

Let's continue by implementing [specific file or feature to focus on].
```

This structure will provide sufficient context while keeping the prompt concise.

## Session History

### Session 1 (April 26, 2025)
- Created initial repository structure
- Implemented core Gmail analysis functionality
- Set up knowledge graph structure
- Created proof of concept for contact tracking

### Session 2 (May 2, 2025)
- Created project status tracker
- Working on contact-manager.js implementation

## Notes for Further Development

- Knowledge graph entities should follow the established naming conventions (contact_*, organization_*, etc.)
- All functions should include comprehensive error handling
- The system architecture follows a modular design where specialized utilities handle specific aspects
- The contact-manager should provide a simple, natural language interface for all operations
