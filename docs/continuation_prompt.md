# Continuation Prompt

Use the following prompt to continue work on the contact management project in a new chat:

```
I'm working on my contact management project that uses Claude's capabilities to analyze Gmail communication and build a knowledge graph of my most important contacts.

In our previous session, we:
1. Created a proof of concept for analyzing emails (tested with lucas@entronic.com)
2. Successfully implemented a knowledge graph using Claude's Memory MCP tools
3. Designed a contact tracking and synchronization system
4. Created comprehensive documentation of our findings and implementation

The knowledge graph already contains:
- Lucas Introne (Contact) with analysis metadata
- Entronic (Organization) 
- Tyler Technologies (Organization)
- Contact Sync Index (System entity for tracking synchronization)
- Analysis Metadata (System entity for tracking analysis status)

Let's continue building this system by implementing:

1. A function to analyze multiple emails for a contact and update their knowledge graph entry
2. An importance scoring algorithm to rank contacts
3. A contact categorization system
4. A reporting system to show top contacts by category

Please access the existing knowledge graph and provide examples of how to implement these next components.
```

This prompt will:
1. Provide context on what we've accomplished so far
2. Specify what entities are already in the knowledge graph
3. Outline the next components we want to implement
4. Ask Claude to access the existing knowledge graph we've created

The knowledge graph data should persist between conversations through Claude's Memory MCP, allowing us to continue building on our work seamlessly.
