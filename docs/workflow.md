# Contact Project Workflow Guide for Claude Desktop

This guide explains how to use the Contact Project system with Claude Desktop's Gmail integration to identify and communicate with your most important contacts.

## Overview

The Contact Project system helps you:

1. Identify and rank your most important contacts from your Gmail communication history
2. Generate personalized outreach messages based on contact categories
3. Track response rates and communication effectiveness
4. Work towards the goal of maintaining strong relationships with your top 150 contacts

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Analyzing Email Communication

To analyze your Gmail communication patterns and rank contacts by importance:

```
Please analyze my email communication with my contacts and update their importance metrics.
```

You can specify different analysis modes:
- **Quick mode**: Only analyzes your most important contacts (fastest)
- **Normal mode**: Analyzes a moderate number of contacts (default)
- **Deep mode**: Analyzes all contacts (most thorough but slowest)

Example:
```
Please analyze my email communication in deep mode to get a complete picture of all my contacts.
```

### 2. Generating Top Contacts Report

To identify your most important contacts:

```
Please generate a report of my top 150 contacts by importance.
```

This will create a detailed report showing:
- Contacts ranked by importance score
- Grouping by importance tier (Very High, High, Medium, Low)
- Last contact date and responsiveness metrics
- Strategic recommendations

### 3. Sending Personalized Emails

To generate and send personalized emails to your top contacts:

```
Please generate personalized emails for my top 20 contacts with my new contact information:
- Email: larry@newdomain.com
- Phone: 212-555-1234
- Address: 123 New Street, New York, NY
```

The system will:
- Generate emails based on contact categories (Investor, Family, Colleague, etc.)
- Apply personalization based on importance score
- Embed stealth tracking codes in email signatures
- Send emails through Gmail

### 4. Checking for Responses

To check if contacts have responded to your outreach:

```
Please check for responses to my outreach emails and update my tracking metrics.
```

This will:
- Search Gmail for responses from your contacts
- Decode signature tracking to identify respondents
- Calculate response rates and timing
- Update the tracking system

### 5. Generating Effectiveness Reports

To see how effective your outreach has been:

```
Please generate an effectiveness report for my contact outreach.
```

This creates a report showing:
- Overall response rates
- Category-based performance analysis
- Response timing metrics
- Weekly trends

### 6. Tracking Progress Towards Top 150 Goal

To monitor your progress towards having 150 high-importance contacts:

```
Please generate a progress report for my top 150 contacts goal.
```

This shows:
- Current number of high-importance contacts
- Progress percentage towards goal
- Distribution of contacts by importance tier
- Strategic recommendations

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Priority Adjustments

To manually adjust the importance of specific contacts:

```
Please set the manual priority for contact "[NAME]" to [1-10].
```

### Category Management

To categorize contacts:

```
Please categorize contact "[NAME]" as "[CATEGORY]".
```

Common categories include: Investor, Family, Colleague, Client, Industry Leader, etc.

### Customizing Email Templates

You can request customized email templates for different contact categories:

```
Please update the email template for "[CATEGORY]" contacts with this new text: 
[YOUR TEMPLATE TEXT]
```

## How It Works Behind the Scenes

1. **Gmail Analysis**: The system uses Claude's Gmail access to analyze your email patterns
2. **Knowledge Graph**: Stores multi-dimensional data about your contacts and relationships
3. **Importance Algorithm**: Ranks contacts based on communication frequency, recency, and response patterns
4. **Signature Encoding**: Embeds unique identifiers in email signatures for tracking
5. **Category-Based Personalization**: Customizes emails based on contact category

## Tips for Best Results

1. Start with a "normal" mode analysis to get initial results quickly
2. Review the top contacts report and make manual adjustments if needed
3. Send emails to smaller batches (10-20) at first to gauge effectiveness
4. Check for responses after 3-5 days
5. Run a "deep" analysis periodically (monthly) to keep data fresh

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Contact not found**: Make sure the contact's email is in your Gmail contacts
2. **Low importance scores**: Check if the contact has sufficient email history
3. **Template issues**: Verify the template exists for the specified category
4. **Response tracking problems**: Check if the original email was sent with tracking enabled
