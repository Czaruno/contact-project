# Contact Management and Outreach Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify and rank the top 150 most important contacts from a larger database of 2000+ contacts, and to facilitate targeted outreach with new contact information. The system uses a knowledge graph approach to track multi-dimensional attributes about each contact and monitor communication effectiveness.

## Latest Updates
- âœ… Completed proof of concept for Gmail analysis and knowledge graph storage
- âœ… Successfully implemented contact tracking using Claude's Memory MCP
- âœ… Designed a synchronization system for Google Contacts
- âœ… Tested extraction of relationship data from email communications

See [proof of concept results](docs/proof_of_concept.md) for details.

## Goals
- Create a knowledge graph of all contacts with multi-dimensional attributes
- Analyze and rank contacts by importance
- Identify the top 150 most important contacts
- Generate personalized outreach messages with stealth tracking
- Monitor communication effectiveness and response rates

## Architecture
This project uses Claude Desktop's Gmail integration to manage contacts, generate and send emails, and track responses. The knowledge graph approach stores multi-dimensional data about contacts and their relationships, enabling sophisticated ranking and personalization.

## Key Concepts

### Knowledge Graph
- Entities: Contacts, Organizations, Categories
- Relationships: works_at, is_categorized_as, introduced
- Multi-dimensional tracking of importance factors
- [Implementation details](docs/mcp_implementation.md)

### Gmail Analysis
- Extract relationship data from email communications
- Analyze communication patterns and contact significance
- Track response rates and engagement metrics
- [Analysis approach](docs/gmail_analysis.md)

### Contact Ranking
- Communication frequency and recency
- Response rate analysis
- Meeting frequency
- Manual priority flags

### Stealth Tracking
- Signature encoding using visually similar Unicode separators
- Capacity for 216+ unique identifiers
- Non-obvious tracking that persists through email threads

### Reporting System
- Progress toward top 150 goal
- Category-based effectiveness analysis
- Response rate monitoring
- Weekly trend analysis

## Usage

This system is designed to be used with Claude Desktop. Instead of running code directly, you interact with Claude using natural language commands:

1. **Analyze Emails**: "Please analyze my email communication with my contacts."
2. **Generate Report**: "Please generate a report of my top 150 contacts."
3. **Send Emails**: "Please generate personalized emails for my top 20 contacts."
4. **Check Responses**: "Please check for responses to my outreach emails."
5. **View Effectiveness**: "Please generate an effectiveness report for my outreach."

See the [workflow guide](docs/workflow.md) for detailed instructions on using the system.

## Benefits of Claude Desktop Implementation

1. **No Setup Required**: No need for API keys, OAuth credentials, or server infrastructure
2. **Direct Gmail Integration**: Seamless access to your Gmail data
3. **Natural Language Interface**: Simple commands instead of complex APIs
4. **Security**: Your data never leaves your conversation with Claude
5. **Immediate Use**: Start using right away without installation
6. **Persistent Knowledge Graph**: Data stored in Memory MCP persists across conversations

## Next Steps

Our immediate next steps are:
1. Implement contact import from Google Contacts
2. Build full email analysis pipeline for top contacts
3. Finalize importance scoring algorithm
4. Create personalized outreach system with tracking
5. Develop reporting functions for contact management
